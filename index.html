<p>&ldquo;those chunks of molten iron which we draw from the furnaces and cast into the teeth of cylinders that turn more rapidly than the wind. These furnaces emit a liquid fire that, in its boiling and heaving, throws off a shower of glowing drops into the air; and from the teeth of the cylinder, iron emerges drastically reduced. We too, in truth, are hard pressed like these masses of iron.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I was once working with a customer who was producing on-board software for a missile.  In my analysis of the code, I pointed out that they had a number of problems with storage leaks.  Imagine my surprise when the customers chief software engineer said &ldquo;Of course it leaks&rdquo;.  He went on to point out that they had calculated the amount of memory the application would leak in the total possible flight time for the missile and then doubled that number.  They added this much additional memory to the hardware to &ldquo;support&rdquo; the leaks.  Since the missile will explode when it hits it&rsquo;s target or at the end of it&rsquo;s flight, the ultimate in garbage collection is performed without programmer intervention.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>boom town</p>

<p>noun&copy; /ˈbuːm ˌtaʊn/</p>

<p>-a town undergoing rapid growth due to sudden prosperity.</p>

<p><em>BOOMTOWN consists of two parts:</em></p>

<p><em>B1: a Computer-Numerically-Controlled (CNC) scoop, suspended over a 5 meter by 2 tray, containing strata of black iron oxide, chalk and soil.</em></p>

<p><em>B2: a research project examining a dead Boomtown: Butte, Montana - examining fantasy, displacement, and ecological devastation.</em>

			Under capitalism, discourse is structured so that violence is invisible. If it reaches us at all, it comes through dry statistics, atomized experience, or anecdotal accounts.
For this reason, violence occurs as an inexplicable irruption: a senseless fight, a riot that comes from nowhere, a burned car, a dead body you discover in the back yard.
After some time, we mostly manage to pull these irruptions back into line. Or, we stop counting them, like the Sarkozy government did to the thousands of cars that burn every year in the banlieues.

			Post-internet art was coined, at least in part, to describe a new phase of the internet as a cultural force - the internet as a banalized norm.
This, I think, is crazy. We are to the internet what the first cave-painter to draw an elk was to painting. The last years have been years of tumult, torment even, and it&rsquo;s not escaped anybody&rsquo;s notice that these upsets have been in part, driven by the internet.
