				<p>boom town</p>

<p>noun&copy; /ˈbuːm ˌtaʊn/</p>

<p>-a town undergoing rapid growth due to sudden prosperity.</p>

<p><em>BOOMTOWN consists of two parts:</em></p>

<p><em>B1: a Computer-Numerically-Controlled (CNC) scoop, suspended over a 5 meter by 2 tray, containing strata of black iron oxide, chalk and soil.</em></p>

<p><em>B2: a research project examining a dead Boomtown: Butte, Montana - examining fantasy, displacement, and ecological devastation.</em>
</p>

<p>For Marx, cities in the modern sense were made possible by the mass displacement, and mass dispossession. The &lsquo;Okies&rsquo; of <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> were also the shack-dwellers of America&rsquo;s Hoovervilles, and the &lsquo;docile bodies&rsquo; of the workhouses were also the vagrants that haunted the English countryside.</p>

<p>The plantation form, established by this process of &lsquo;primitive accumulation&rsquo;, transformed the landscape from a home, to a space for resource extraction. In turn, the ever expanding scope of resource extraction has created a new geography. The lunar landscapes produced by mining, the barren moors formed by grazing, the blocked and silted rivers, colossal algal blooms and poisoned waters, deserts and dustbowls - in short, the Anthropocene.</p>

<p>In this history, the tractor appeared as a nightmarish figure, the machine that could do the work of a hundred, seen in the distance, pulling down the houses of those &lsquo;starved out&rsquo;, carrying in its clattering engine the germ of an abandoned, empty land, ultimately a desert.</p>

<p><em>B1</em> is intended as a kind of anti-landscape, responding both to the problem of automation, and a linked set of ideas about the relation of machines and time. The materials are intended to evoke both the &lsquo;black blizzards&rsquo; of rural Montana, and the &lsquo;Pulverizations&rsquo; of Robert Smithson.</p>

<p><em>B2</em> is a set of research materials collected in the course of developing <em>B1</em>, loosely grouped under the subheadings:</p>

<p><em>An Empty Space</em>:</p>

<p>a set of texts responding to Negri and Hardt&rsquo;s conception of the American frontier, outlined in <em>Empire</em>.</p>

<p><em>Plagues</em>:</p>

<p>accounts of Montana as an ecosystem in collapse</p>

<p><em>9600 baud</em>:</p>

<p>collated material on CNC in relation to mechanized time, and its malcontents.</p>

<p>and <em>Prehistory</em>:</p>

<p>a critical reading of Robert Smithson&rsquo;s <em>A Sedimentation of the Mind</em>, in the context of Quentin Melliasoux&rsquo;s treatement of the &lsquo;arche-fossil&rsquo; in <em>After Finitude</em>.</p>

<p><em>Boomtown</em> is intended more as the presentation of a set of doubts, than as a collection of theses. The CNC, like the tractor before it, is an inherently doubtful object, containing both the seed of a freedom from the grind of labour, and a real existence as a facet of capitalist triangulation. Its utopian potential is bracketed by the enforced utopian thinking of the american dream, where the &lsquo;fortune seekers&rsquo; of the boomtown appear as a starving band, driven from their farms by debt, and ecological collapse. Most of all, the work is intended to place our current situation in the <em>longue durée</em> of capitalism, towards a general notion of displacement in four centuries of universal diaspora.</p>
