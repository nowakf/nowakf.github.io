				<p>The larger part of the school system were schools developed down to address this problem, as industrialists sought to educate their child labourers, and to inculcate them with the discipline, traditions, and practices of work.</p>

<p>Although formal training could accelerate the acquisition of machine-relevant attitudes, it could never completely prepare its students for a workplace that was in continuous flux, nor do so without implicitly promising a future of employment, which in reality was always uncertain, no matter the training.</p>

<p>In a way, the relationship between the student and industry is a macrocosm of the relationship between the worker and the machine - society is organized and arranged to serve the interests of industry, just as the factory is designed for the machine.</p>

<p>///The bodies are expected to fit in the gaps between them, under them, and amongst them, to be crushed by them without complaint, to endure their thunderous sounds and brave their poisons, and ultimately, to go uproot and relocate when their operation becomes unprofitable.</p>

<p>Frederick Jameson described the current era as Toyotaist, both to illustrate a continuation with, and a departure from, the Fordist society. The Toyotaist society retains the workplace as its prime mover - the base still drives the superstructure - but that base becomes decoupled from the encrustations of massive capital investment; it becomes flexible, made-to-order, irregular, and precarious.</p>

<p>In this, he drew the opposite impression to the managers of the beleaguered american car industry: while Jameson saw Toyota primarily in terms of managerial technique, they saw Toyota in terms of its workers, and their culture. Toyota was able to be flexible precisely because it relied so heavily on skilled and capable workers, who did not need to operate in lockstep to produce cars.</p>

<p>This proved a formula that simply could not be replicated - though not for lack of trying. Even with the willing participation of Toyota, American car makers remain generally unable to escape from the perennial problem of heavily automated industry: overproduction.</p>

<hr />

<p>((While the hatred of industrial culture often merges seamlessly with a contempt for the people who work there - there is also a concern, shared by socialists and conservatives, to protect society from the tumult of industry.  The difference often derives rather from what, and who, they consider society to be.))</p>
