			Post-internet art was coined, at least in part, to describe a new phase of the internet as a cultural force - the internet as a banalized norm.
This, I think, is crazy. We are to the internet what the first cave-painter to draw an elk was to painting. The last years have been years of tumult, torment even, and it&rsquo;s not escaped anybody&rsquo;s notice that these upsets have been in part, driven by the internet.

			(This is all theory - I&rsquo;ve yet to make acid etched PCB prints - so far, I&rsquo;ve just done drypoint.)
One of the main problems facing printmakers who want to work on metal plates is the cost of everything involved, from the plates (copper, zinc), to the printing machine itself.
From this perspective, PCB plates offer an interesting alternative. They can be etched with any kind of copper etchant (Ferric Chloride is standard), polished, and inked.

			BACKGROUND:
There are a great many texts1 that talk about how, even by simple presence in a city, a sense of freedom is produced.2 This freedom comes in two components: first, the freedom from the basic violence of nature. Second, the freedom from the oppressive family structure, invasive community organization, and violence of traditional farm life.3
The first and second points are perhaps underlying the creative vibrancy of cities. Freed from the grueling demands of agriculture, and the geographical isolation of rural community, cities have consistently been powerful sites of technical and cultural innovation.
