			Under capitalism, discourse is structured so that violence is invisible. If it reaches us at all, it comes through dry statistics, atomized experience, or anecdotal accounts.
For this reason, violence occurs as an inexplicable irruption: a senseless fight, a riot that comes from nowhere, a burned car, a dead body you discover in the back yard.
After some time, we mostly manage to pull these irruptions back into line. Or, we stop counting them, like the Sarkozy government did to the thousands of cars that burn every year in the banlieues.

			<br>
			Post-internet art was coined, at least in part, to describe a new phase of the internet as a cultural force - the internet as a banalized norm.
This, I think, is crazy. We are to the internet what the first cave-painter to draw an elk was to painting. The last years have been years of tumult, torment even, and it&rsquo;s not escaped anybody&rsquo;s notice that these upsets have been in part, driven by the internet.

			<time>27.04.2017</time> 
			<br>
			One of the main problems facing printmakers who want to work on metal plates is the cost of everything involved, from the plates (copper, zinc), to the printing machine itself.
From this perspective, PCB plates offer an interesting alternative. They can be etched with any kind of copper etchant (Ferric Chloride is standard), polished, and inked. They typically cost around half what copper costs, per square centimeter. The copper is, I suspect, better quality (since there really is no incentive to not adulterate copper sheet materials, whereas alloying copper for use in electrical circuits is, I think, a bad idea1).

			BACKGROUND:
There are a great many texts1 that talk about how, even by simple presence in a city, a sense of freedom is produced.2 This freedom comes in two components: first, the freedom from the basic violence of nature. Second, the freedom from the oppressive family structure, invasive community organization, and violence of traditional farm life.3
The first and second points are perhaps underlying the creative vibrancy of cities. Freed from the grueling demands of agriculture, and the geographical isolation of rural community, cities have consistently been powerful sites of technical and cultural innovation.

			The larger part of the school system were schools developed down to address this problem, as industrialists sought to educate their child labourers, and to inculcate them with the discipline, traditions, and practices of work.
Although formal training could accelerate the acquisition of machine-relevant attitudes, it could never completely prepare its students for a workplace that was in continuous flux, nor do so without implicitly promising a future of employment, which in reality was always uncertain, no matter the training.
